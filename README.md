# PHP User Signup/Login System (WIP)

This is a simple user signup/login system implemented in PHP and MySQL. It is mostly a practice project to me.

## Considerations

- Make sure you have MySQL server installed. Backend will try to connect to it when starting.

## Features

- User registration with email and password
- User login with email and password
- Password hashing for secure storage
- MySQL database integration

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YozoraWolf/wolf-vitephp-user-system`
2. Run `php -S localhost:8001` (It can be any port you want)

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8001/login.php`
2. Register a new user account
3. Login with your credentials
